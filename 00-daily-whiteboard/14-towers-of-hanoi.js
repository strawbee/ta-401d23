/*
The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes.
The puzzle starts with the disks sorted (i.e. smaller disks sits on top of larger disks) on the 
left-most tower, and the objective of the puzzle is to move the disks to the right-most tower with 
the following restrictions:
Only one disk can be moved at a given time.
A disk is moved from the top of a tower to the top of another tower.
A disk canâ€™t be placed on top of a smaller disk.
