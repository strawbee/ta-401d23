====

## To Submit this Assignment
  * fork this repository
  * push to your repository
  * submit a pull request to this repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas
  * write a question and observation on canvas

## Requirements  
#### Configuration  
  <!-- list of files, configurations, tools, etc that are required -->
  Your lab directory must include  
  * **README.md** -- with a documentation about your lab
  * **.gitignore** -- with a robust .gitignore
  * **.eslintrc** -- with the class .eslintrc file
  * **.eslintignore** -- with the class .eslintignore
  * **.package.json** -- with all dependencies and dev-dependencies
  * **lib/** -- directory for holding your programs helper modules
  * **__test__/** -- directory for holding your programs unit and integration tests

#### Testing  
  * write at least three test assertions for each method of the List Data Structure
  * organize your tests into appropriate describe/it blocks for test output readability

####  Documentation  
  * in your README, write documentation for you data structures
  * your documentation should includes code block examples
  * provide instructions for:
    * installing and using your data structure
    * accessing each method
    * running your tests

#### Feature Tasks  
  * implement a `LinkedList` class
  * implement a `pop()` on the List prototype
	* implement a `remove(value)` on the prototype
  * implement `map()` _or_ `reduce()` as pure methods on the List prototype
  * in comments above or within each function, note the Big-O runtime

## Bonus Points:
  * 2pts
  * refactor the List data structor so that `push()` and `pop()` both have a constant / O(1) run time

#### Rubric:
  * Tests: 2pts
  * Passes linter: 1pts
  * Completed Data Structure: 3pts
  * Completed FP methods: 2pts
  * Big-O notation: 2pt
